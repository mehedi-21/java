#  <u>Encapsulation</u>

### What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation describes the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit, like a class in Java. This concept is also often used to hide the internal representation or state of an object from the outside. This is called information hiding.

In laptop program, variables(display_size,processor,hard_disk) and methods(display(),laptop()) are encapsulated.

Another example, variables(self,library_name,category) and methods(library(),display()) are encapsulated in library program.
